NOTES:
  - 3 data entry systems:
    - ECW:
      - eClinicalWorks
      - stores scanned copies of physical documents in addition to 
    - MIDAS:
      - St. John's dbms
      - 
    - MySQL:
      - stores logistical information extracted from ecw/midas

- patient is designated as research if they have a surgery at st. johns
  - surgery in the same region, stop following first region, follow new region
  - surgery in different region, follow both regions

- export list from ecw:
  - 

- Questions: do we schedule a couple of months out and then just print out the schedule for the day?
  - no, currently we just create schedule for the day, because it takes 2 hours to generate the schedule
  - IMPORTANT: this can be automated...
  - time consuming part:
    - need to look at patient docs for every single person and check if new surgery occurred because the manual data is not 
      trustworthy
    - 
- Scheduling process can be automated, just need to upload the text file from ecw into
  a program that is connected to mysql.
